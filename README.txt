# Stable Diffusion Image Generator in JupyterLab

This project sets up a JupyterLab environment in GitHub Codespaces for generating images using Stable Diffusion.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a new GitHub repository and clone this project into it.
2. Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces.
3. Wait for the Codespace to finish setting up (this may take a few minutes as it installs all dependencies).

## Usage Instructions

1. Once the Codespace is ready, open the `stable_diffusion_generator.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run all cells in the notebook.
3. Use the text input to enter your desired image description.
4. Click the "Generate" button to create the image.
5. The generated image will be displayed below the input widgets.

## Notes

- The first time you generate an image, it may take a while as the model is downloaded and loaded.
- Subsequent generations should be faster.
- Images are saved in the same directory as the notebook with names like `generated_image_1234567890.png`.

Enjoy creating images with Stable Diffusion!
